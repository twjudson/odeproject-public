    <introduction>
        <p>If we view the differential equation <m>y' = f(t,y)</m> as a formula for the slope of a tangent line to a solution curve, we can approximate the graph of a solution curve.  For example, if we consider the equation <m>y' = t + y</m>, then a solution curve will have a slope of <m>2</m> at the point <m>(1, 1)</m>. We can use this information to obtain a geometric description of the solutions to the equation.</p>

        <title>RC Circuits</title>

        <p>Suppose that we wish to analyze how an electric current flows through a circuit. An <term>RC circuit</term><idx>RC circuit</idx> is a very simple circuit might contain a voltage source, a capacitor, and a resistor (<xref ref="firstlook03-figure-rc-circuit" />). A battery or generator is an example of a voltage source. The glowing red heating element in a toaster or an electric stove is an example of something that provides resistance in a circuit. A capacitor stores an electrical charge and can be made by separating two metal plates with an insulating material. Capacitors are used to power the electronic flashes for cameras. Current, <m>I(t)</m>, is the rate at which a charge flows through this circuit and is measured in amperes or amps (A). We assign a direction to the current. A current flowing in the opposite direction will be given negative values.</p>

        <p>The source voltage, <m>E(t)</m>, is measured in volts (V). <term>Kirchhoff's Second Law</term><idx>Kirchhoff's Second Law</idx> tells us that the impressed voltage in a closed circuit is equal to the sum of the voltage drops in the rest of the circuit. Thus, we need only compute the voltage drop across the resistor, <m>E_R</m>, and the voltage drop across the capacitor, <m>E_C</m>. According to Kirchhoff's Law, this is
            <me>E_R + E_C = E.</me></p>

       <p>Resistance, <m>R</m>, to the current is measured in ohms (<m>\Omega</m>). <term>Ohm's Law</term><idx>Ohm's Law</idx> tells us that the voltage drop across a resistor is given by 
            <men xml:id="firstlook03-equation-ohms-law">E_R = IR.</men>
        Finally, capacitance, <m>C</m>, is measured in farads (F).  <term>Coulomb's Law</term><idx>Coulomb's Law</idx> tells us how current flows across a capacitor,
            <men xml:id="firstlook03-equation-coulombs-law">I = C \frac{d E_C}{dt}. </men>
        Thus, if we combine the equations<nbsp /><xref ref="firstlook03-equation-ohms-law" /> and<nbsp /><xref ref="firstlook03-equation-coulombs-law" />, our equation <m>E_R + E_C = E</m> becomes
            <men xml:id="firstlook03-equation-rc-circuit">RC \frac{d E_C}{dt} + E_C = E(t).</men></p>

       <p>We will now investigate how our circuit reacts under different voltage sources. For example, we might have a zero voltage source (the capacitor could still hold a charge). We could also have a constant nonzero source of voltage such as a battery or a fluctuating source of voltage such as a generator. We might even have a series of pulses of voltage where the current is periodically turned on and off. We would like to be able to understand the solutions to the equation<nbsp /><xref ref="firstlook03-equation-rc-circuit" /> for different voltage sources <m>E(t)</m>. If we view the differential equation<nbsp /><xref ref="firstlook03-equation-rc-circuit" /> as an expression for computing how fast current is flowing across the capacitor, we can analyze our circuit from a geometric point of view and can actually say a great deal about circuits without solving a differential equation.</p>

        <title>Direction Fields</title>

        <p>Any differential equation
            <me>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)</me>
        can be viewed as a formula for the slope of a function <m>y = y(t)</m>. Geometrically, the equation tells us that, at any point <m>(t_0, y_0)</m>, the slope of a solution curve is given by <m>f(t_0, y_0)</m>. Suppose that our differential equation is defined on the rectangle <m>R = [a, b] \times [c, d]</m>, and let <m>y(t)</m> be a solution curve for <m>y' = f(t, y)</m> that passes through the point <m>(t_0, y_0)</m>.  Then the differential equation tells us the slope of this solution curve at <m>(t_0, y_0)</m>. We can indicate this on the <m>(t, y)</m>-plane by drawing a short line segment at the point <m>(t, y)</m> with slope <m>f(t_0, y_0)</m>. Thus, we can obtain a <term>direction field</term><idx>direction field</idx> or <term>slope field</term><idx>slope field</idx> for the differential equation. A solution curve must be tangent to its direction field at every point.</p>

        <p>For example, consider the differential equation <m>y' = y^2/2 - t</m>. The direction field for this equation is given in <xref ref="firstlook03-figure-direction-field" /> along with several solution curves.</p>

        <p>Although direction fields can be tedious to compute using pencil and paper, we can easily generate direction fields for any differential equation with the use of computer software.

We will learn how to add solution curves at the end of this section.</p>

        <title>Autonomous Differential Equations</title>

        <p>An <term>autonomous differential equation</term><idx><h>differential equation</h><h>autonomous</h></idx> is one of the form

        In other words, a differential equation is autonomous if the variable <m>t</m> does not appear on the righthand side of the equation. Since an autonomous differential equation <m>dx/dt = f(x)</m> only depends on the variable <m>x</m>, its direction field is particularly easy to graph.

        <p>Notice that <m>dP/dt = 0</m> when <m>P= 40</m> or <m>P = 160</m>. Thus, the two constant solutions <m>P(t) = 40</m> and <m>P(t) = 160</m> are the same for all values of the independent variable <m>t</m>. We say that such a solution is an <term>equilibrium solution</term><idx>equilibrium solution</idx>. Equilibrium solutions graph as horizontal lines on the direction field. We can identify equilibrium solutions by setting the derivative of the function equal to zero. On our phase line we will represent these solutions as equilibrium points. For values of <m>P</m> between 40 and 160, we know that <m>dP/dt \gt 0</m>. Thus, any solution curve must be increasing. We denote this property on the phase line by drawing an upward pointing arrow. On the other hand, we know that <m>dP/dt \lt 0</m> when <m>P \lt 40</m> or <m>P \gt 160</m>. In this case any solution curve will be decreasing, and we will indicate this by a downward pointing arrow.</p>

        <p>Let <m>y' = f(y)</m> and suppose that <m>y = y_0</m> is an equilibrium solution. We say this solution is a <term>sink</term><idx><h>equilibrium solution</h><h>sink</h></idx> if for any solution <m>y(t)</m> with initial condition sufficiently close to <m>y_0</m>, we have

When <m>P= 40</m>, we have a source, and when <m>P = 160</m>, we have a sink.</p>

        <p>An equilibrium solution is <term>stable</term><idx><h>equilibrium solution</h><h>stable</h></idx> if a small change in the initial conditions gives a solution which tends toward the equilibrium as the independent variable tends towards positive infinity.

        </activity>

        <p>One of the reasons why autonomous equations are so important is Taylor's theorem, which tells us that any function <m>f(x)</m> can be approximated near a point <m>x_0</m> by an <m>n</m>th degree polynomial,
            <me>f(x) \approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) + \frac{ f''(x_0)}{2!} (x - x_0)^2 + \cdots + \frac{ f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!} (x - x_0)^n</me>
        near <m>x_0</m>.  For example, if
            <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) = \cos(x^2 + \pi)</me>
        with <m>x(0) = x_0</m>, then we may approximate this initial value problem near <m>x_0</m> with
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; =  f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) = \cos(x_0^2 + \pi) + 2 x _0 \sin(x_0^2 + \pi)(x - x_0)</mrow>
                <mrow>x(0) &amp; = x_0.</mrow>
            </md>
        Of course, this strategy might not work very well if <m>f(x_0) = \cos(x_0^2 + \pi) = 0</m> or <m>f'(x_0) = 2 x _0 \sin(x_0^2 + \pi) = 0</m>.</p>
