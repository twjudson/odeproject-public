    <introduction>

        <p>In <xref ref="linear" />, we explored how to solve linear systems. However, if we are asked to solve a nonlinear system such as 
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x - 3y + xy^2</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 2x - 4y - x^2y,</mrow>
            </md>
        we are faced with a much more difficult task. In general, it may not be possible to find solutions for a nonlinear system in terms of elementary functions. However, for a given modeling problem, we can ask many questions that may be answered without finding an explicit solution for the associated system of differential equations. For example, what are the equilibrium points? Are the equilibrium points stable? Do closed solution curves exist in the phase plane?</p>

    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="nonlinear01-subsection-equilibrium-solutions">
        <title>Equilibrium Solutions</title>

        <p>An <term>equilibrium solution</term> for a first-order system of differential equations
            <md>
                <mrow>x'(t) &amp; = f(x, y)</mrow>
                <mrow>y'(t) &amp; = g(x, y)</mrow>
            </md>
        is a point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> such that
            <me>f(x_0, y_0) = g(x_0, y_0) = 0.</me>
        Notice that neither <m>x</m> nor <m>y</m> is changing at this point. If we have the initial conditions, <m>x(0) = x_0</m> and <m>y(0) = y_0</m>, then the solution to the system is <m>x(t) = x_0</m> and <m>y(t) = y_0</m>. Of course the interesting question is what happens if our initial conditions are close to an equilibrium solution. Do solutions tend toward the equilibrium solution, away from the equilibrium solution, or is there a combination of the two?</p>

        <p>One of the most useful methods of determining the nature of an equilibrium solution for a given nonlinear system is to approximate the nonlinear system with a linear system. More specifically, an equilibrium solution occurs for the linear system
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = f(x,y)</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = g(x, y)</mrow>
            </md>
        when an <m>x</m>-nullcline intersects a <m>y</m>-nullcline. That is, when a curve defined by <m>dx/dt = f(x,y) = 0</m> intersects a curve defined <m>dy/dt = g(x,y) = 0</m>, we have an equilibrium solution. Since the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>-nullclines are simply curves in the <m>xy</m>-plane, we can approximate them locally by intersecting straight lines.  Translating the pair of intersection lines to the origin, we obtain a linear system, and we can apply everything that we learned about such systems in <xref ref="linear" />.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>Consider the system
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x - 3y + xy^2</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 2x - 4y - x^2y.</mrow>
                </md>
            From
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x - 3y + xy^2 = 0</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 2x - 4y - x^2y = 0,</mrow>
                </md>
            we can quickly conclude that the only equilibrium solution to the system is <m>(0, 0)</m>. The phase portrait for this system is given in <xref ref="nonlinear01-figure-example-1" />. If we have the initial conditions <m>x(0) = 1</m> and <m>y(0) = 1</m>, we can see that the solution tends toward the origin as <m>t \to \infty</m>. However, it is unclear from the phase portrait if the solution curves of all initial value problems with initial conditions near the origin tend towards the equilibrium solution as <m>t \to \infty</m>.</p>

           <figure xml:id="nonlinear01-figure-example-1">
                 <image width="60%">

            </figure>

            <p>Since the nonlinear terms of the system do not contribute much towards <m>dx/dt</m> and <m>dy/dt</m> for values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> near zero, we can determine the nature of the equilibrium solution by examining the system consisting of only linear terms on the right-hand side of the equation,
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x - 3y</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 2x - 4y.</mrow>
                </md>
            The matrix for this linear system,
                <me>A =
                \begin{pmatrix}
                1 &amp; -3 \\
                2 &amp; -4
                \end{pmatrix},</me>
            has eigenvalues <m>\lambda = -1</m> and <m>\mu = -2</m> with eigenvectors <m>\mathbf u = (3,2)</m> and <m>\mathbf v = (1,1)</m>, respectively. The general solution for this linear system is
                <md>
                    <mrow>x(t) &amp; = 3 c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-2t}</mrow>
                    <mrow>y(t) &amp; = 2c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-2t}.</mrow>
                </md>
            This indeed suggests that solutions near the origin tend towards the origin as <m>t \to \infty</m>. In this case, we say that the equilibrium solution is <term>stable</term>. Of course, if we are given an initial condition such as <m>x(0) = -0.5</m> and <m>y(0) = 1</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <title>A Competing Species Model</title>
    
            <p>Suppose that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are the population of two distinct species that compete for the same resources. For example, two species of fish may compete for the same food in a lake or sheep and cattle competing for the same grazing land.  Recall from <xref ref="systems02" /> that we can model two competing species using the following system of first-order differential equations,
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = \alpha x \left(1 - \frac{x}{M} \right) - \beta xy</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = \gamma y \left(1 - \frac{y}{N} \right) - \delta xy.</mrow>
                </md>
            The first term in each equation is the logistic growth of each species. The second term in each equation tells how each species is affected by interacting with the competing species.</p>

            <p>More specifically, let us consider the following system,
                <mdn>
                    <mrow xml:id="nonlinear01-equation-competing-species-1">\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = 2x\left(1-\frac{x}{2}\right) - xy</mrow>
                    <mrow xml:id="nonlinear01-equation-competing-species-2">\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 3y\left(1- \frac{y}{3}\right) - 2xy.</mrow>
                </mdn>
            It is easy to see that  the four equilibrium solutions: <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(0,3)</m>, <m>(2,0)</m>, and <m>(1, 1)</m>.  We can view the direction field, the phase plane, and some solution curves for this system in <xref ref="nonlinear01-figure-competing-species" />.</p>

            <p>Let us analyze what happens at the equilibrium solution <m>(1, 1)</m>. If we decide on an appropriate change of variables, we can translate the entire system so that this equilibrium solution is at the origin. If we let

            The idea is that the linear part is a good <term>local</term> approximation to the original equations much like a tangent line is a good local approximation to a smooth function in calculus. We can determine the local nature of the equilibrium solution by examining the eigenvalues of the matrix
                <me>A
                =
                \begin{pmatrix}
                -1 &amp; -1 \\
                -2 &amp; -1
                \end{pmatrix}.</me>
            The eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are <m>\lambda = -1 + \sqrt{2} = 0.4142</m> and <m>\mu = -1 - \sqrt{2} \approx -2.4142</m> with eigenvectors <m>\mathbf u = (1,\sqrt{2}\,) \approx (1, 1.4142)</m> and <m>\mathbf v = (1,-\sqrt{2}\,)  \approx (1, -1.4142)</m>, respectively.  The solution to the linear system is now
                <me>\mathbf x(t) = c_1  e^{\lambda t} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} + c_2 e^{\mu t} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix}.</me>
            or

            <p>If we have initial conditions <m>x(0) = 3</m> and <m>y(0) = 4</m>, one can quickly determine that <m>c_1 = 3/2 + \sqrt{2} \approx 2.9142</m> and <m>c_2 = 3/2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 0.0859</m>, and equations<nbsp /><xref ref="nonlinear01-equation-competing-species-7" /> and <xref ref="nonlinear01-equation-competing-species-8" /> become

            Certainly, this sytems has an equilibrium solution at <m>(0,0)</m> (<xref ref="nonlinear01-figure-nonpoly-phase-portrait" />).  We can expand <m>\sin x</m> into a power series,

        <p>In general, our goal is to approximate a nonlinear system
            <mdn>
                <mrow xml:id="nonlinear01-equation-nonlinear-system-1">x'(t) \amp = f(x,y)</mrow>
                <mrow xml:id="nonlinear01-equation-nonlinear-system-2">y'(t) \amp = g(x, y)</mrow>
            </mdn>
        near each equilibrium point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> with a linear system. The idea is to move the equilibrium solution to the origin with a change of coordinates and then approximate the nonlinear system with a linear system. In order to move the equilibrium solution to the origin, we will introduce new variables
            <md>
                <mrow>u \amp = x - x_0</mrow>
                <mrow>v \amp = y - y_0.</mrow>
            </md>
        If <m>(x,y)</m> is close to the equilibrium solution <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>, then <m>(u, v)</m> will be close to the origin. Under this change of coordinates,
            <me>\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (x - x_0) = \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) = f(x_0 + u, y_0 + v).</me>
        Similarly, <m>dv/dt = dy/dt = g(x_0 + u, y_0 + v)</m>.</p>

        <p>In order to approximate the nonlinear system with a linear system, we will use a Taylor series in two variables. That is, we can write
            <md>
                <mrow>f(x_0 + u, y_0 + v) \amp = f(x_0, y_0) +  f_x(x_0, y_0)u + f_y(x_0, y_0)v</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp + \frac{1}{2} f_{xx}(x_0, y_0) u^2 + f_{xy}(x_0, y_0) uv + \frac{1}{2} f_{yy}(x_0, y_0) v^2 + \cdots.</mrow>
            </md> 
        If we only use the linear terms of the Taylor series, we obtain a fairly accurate approximation of <m>f</m> provided we are near the equilibrium solution. Of course, <m>f</m> and its linear approximation may be quite different for values far away from the equilibrium solution. The linearization of the system of equations<nbsp /><xref ref="nonlinear01-equation-nonlinear-system-1" /><ndash /><xref ref="nonlinear01-equation-nonlinear-system-2" /> now becomes
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{du}{dt} =  f(x_0, y_0) +  f_x(x_0, y_0)u + f_y(x_0, y_0)v</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} =  g(x_0, y_0) +  g_x(x_0, y_0)u + g_y(x_0, y_0)v.</mrow>
            </md>
        Since <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> is an equilibrium solution, the constant terms vanish in each equation and
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{du}{dt} \amp = f_x(x_0, y_0)u + f_y(x_0, y_0)v</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} \amp = g_x(x_0, y_0)u + g_y(x_0, y_0)v.</mrow>
            </md></p>
        
        <p>If we write our linearization in matrix form, we have
            <me>\begin{pmatrix}  du/dt \\ dv/dt \end{pmatrix}
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
            f_x(x_0, y_0) \amp f_y(x_0, y_0) \\
            g_x(x_0, y_0) \amp g_y(x_0, y_0)
            \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix}  u \\ v \end{pmatrix}.</me>
        The matrix
            <me>J
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
            f_x(x_0, y_0)\amp f_y(x_0, y_0) \\
            g_x(x_0, y_0) \amp g_y(x_0, y_0)
            \end{pmatrix}</me>
        is the <term>Jacobian matrix</term> of the system. We can now classify equilibrium solutions of nonlinear systems by examining the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the system or by using the trace-determinant plane. For example, if <m>D =\det(J) \gt 0</m> and <m>T =\trace(J) \lt 0</m>, we have a sink. We can determine the sink to be spiral or nodal by examining whether <m>(T, D)</m> lies above or below the parabola <m>T^2 = 4D</m> in the trace-determinant plane.</p>

        </notation>

        <p>It is important to note that linearization only tells us the local story. A solution curve might behave quite differently if it is far away from the equilibrium solution.</p>

        <example>
            <p>In <xref ref="nonlinear01-example-poly" />, we considered the system
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y.</mrow>
                </md>
            The Jacobian matrix of this system is
                <me>J
                =
                \begin{pmatrix}
                f_x(x_0, y_0) \amp f_y(x_0, y_0) \\
                g_x(x_0, y_0) \amp g_y(x_0, y_0)
                \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix}
                2x_0 - 4 \amp -1 \\
                3x_0^2 \amp -1
                \end{pmatrix}</me>
            For the equilibrium solution <m>(1, 1)</m>,
             <me>J =
                \begin{pmatrix}
                -2 \amp -1 \\
                3 \amp -1
                \end{pmatrix}.</me>
             Since <m>J</m> has eigenvalues <m>\lambda = (-3 \pm i \sqrt{11})/2</m>, the equilibrium solution will act as a spiral sink for initial values close to <m>(1,1)</m>.</p>

        <title>When Linearization Fails</title>

        <p>There are at least two cases when linearization does not give us the information that we seek. First, it might well be the case that the linear terms vanish in the nonlinear system. For example, the system
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = xy</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x^2 + xy</mrow> 
            </md>
        has an equilibrium solution at the origin, but this linearization of this system vanishes.</p>

        <p>A more subtle example is the system
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = y - (x^2 + y^2)x</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x - (x^2 + y^2)y.</mrow>
            </md>
        The origin is an equilibrium solution, and the linearization of this system is
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = y</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x.</mrow>
            </md>
        The eigenvalue of the matrix corresponding to the linear system,
            <me>A
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \amp 1 \\
            -1 \amp 0
            \end{pmatrix},</me>
        are <m>\lambda = \pm i</m>. Thus, the solution curves of the linear system are simply circles about the origin. However, the nonlinear system acts quite differently. In the nonlinear system, solutions spiral out slowly from the origin (<xref ref="nonlinear01-figure-linearization-fails" />). This system has no periodic solutions.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Let us consider an epidemic model for a city. We make the following additional assumptions about our model.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The city has a constant birth rate of <m>\beta</m> persons per day. All new born babies are susceptible to the disease.</li>
                        <li>Infected people either recover or die after a certain number of days. If an individual recovers, he or she is immune.</li>
                    </ul>
                If we let <m>S(t)</m> be the number of susceptible individuals at time <m>t</m> and <m>I(t)</m> be the number of infected individuals at time <m>t</m>, our assumptions give rise to the following system of differential equations,
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; = - \alpha SI + \beta</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} &amp; = - \gamma I + \alpha SI.</mrow>
                    </md>
                The constant <m>\alpha</m> is determined by the probability of an interaction between a susceptible individual and an infected individual, and <m>\gamma</m> is the rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population. If 
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; = - \alpha SI + \beta = 0</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} &amp; = - \gamma I + \alpha SI = 0,</mrow>
                    </md>
                then both the susceptible and infected populations do not change. This will occur at
                    <md>
                        <mrow>S_0 &amp; = \frac{\gamma}{\alpha}</mrow>
                        <mrow>I_0 &amp; = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}.</mrow>
                    </md>
                We are interested in the behavior of solutions near <m>(S_0, I_0)</m>. If solutions approach this equilbrium point, then the disease will become endemic to the population.  Determine whether this is the case.</p>
