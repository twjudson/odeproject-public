<div class="para">Suppose that we have two tanks (<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>) between which a mixture of brine flows. Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains 200 liters of water in which 20 kilograms of salt has been dissolved and Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> contains 200 liters of water in which 10 kilograms of salt has been dissolved. Fresh water is pumped into Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at the rate of 200 liters per hour, and brine is pumped into Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at the rate of 200 liters per hour.
