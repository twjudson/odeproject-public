<div class="para">Systems of differential equations are very useful in epidemiology. Differential equations can be used to model various epidemics, including the  bubonic plague, influenza, AIDS, the 2015 ebola outbreak in west Africa, and the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand how we might model an epidemic, we will consider a very simple situation. We will assume that we have a closed population of size <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> where immigration, emigration, and birth do not play an important role. We will also ignore any deaths that are not related to our disease.</div>
