<div class="para">Oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico or the Amoco Cadiz off the coast of Brittany can have disastrous consequences for society—economically, environmentally, and socially. Even smaller spills such as the Exxon Valdez can have have a huge impact on the surrounding environment due to the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of mounting an emergency environmental response.  Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water, and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.  For this reason the timeliness of an emergency response is critical.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
