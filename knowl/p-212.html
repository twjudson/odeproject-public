<em class="emphasis">Sage</em> has powerful algorithms for finding exact and numerical solutions of differential equations. In addition, we can plot solutions and direction fields. Although some differential equations have an exact solution and can be solved using analytic techniques with calculus, many differential equations can only be solved using numerical techniques. This should not be too surprising if we consider how we solve polynomials. It is quite easy to find the roots of any equation of the form <span class="process-math">\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)</span> by either factoring or using the quadratic equation, but solving an equation such as</div>

\begin{equation*}
5x^7 - 6x^4 +3x^3 -23 x^2 +3x -17 = 0
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">is a much more difficult problem.  Unlike the situation for quadratic equations, there does not exist a general formula for solving seventh degree equations. We can even encounter difficulties when using a numerical method such as the Newton-Raphson algorithm.</div>
