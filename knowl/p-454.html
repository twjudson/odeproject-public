<div class="para">A manager in a communications company contributes $2400 per year into her retirement fund by making many small deposits throughout the year.  The fund grows at a rate of 3.5% per year compounded continuously.  After 35 years, she retires and begins and begins withdrawing from the retirement fund at a rate of $3500 per month.  If she does not make any deposits after she retires, how long will her retirement fund last?  [<em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: Divide the problem into two smaller problemsâ€”one that deals with the situation before retirement and one that deals with the problem after retirement.]</div>
