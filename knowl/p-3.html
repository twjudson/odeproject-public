<div class="para">There has been a strong trend during the past few decades to incorporate both modeling and technology into undergraduate differential equations courses. Since it is easy to insert computational cells inside an HTML version of the textbook with PreTeXt, there is now an opportunity to seemlessly embed technology into the textbook. Sage (<a class="external" href="http://sagemath.org" target="_blank">sagemath.org</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>), our technolgy of choice, is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics.  Sage is ideal for assisting with a study of ordinary differential equations, since it cannot only be embedded as computational cells in a textbook, it can also be used on a computer, a local server, or on CoCalc (<a class="external" href="https://cocalc.com" target="_blank">https://cocalc.com</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>). The Sage code in <em class="emphasis">The Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em> has been tested for accuracy with the most recent version available at this time: Sage Version 9.2 (released 2020–10–24).</div>
