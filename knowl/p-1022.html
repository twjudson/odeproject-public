<div class="para">We will use linear systems of differential equations to illustrate how we can use systems of differential equations to model how subtances flow back and forth between two or more compartments. Suppose that we have two tanks (<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>) between which a mixture of brine flows (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/linear02-figure-mixing-example.html" title="Figure 3.2.1">FigureÂ 3.2.1</a>). Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains 300 liters of water in which 100 kilograms of salt has been dissolved and Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> contains 300 liters of pure water. Fresh water is pumped into Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at the rate of 500 liters per hour, and brine is pumped into Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at the rate of 900 liters per hour. Brine is also pumped back into Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> from Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> at the rate of 400 liters per hour, and an additional 500 liters of brine per hour is drained from Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> All brine mixtures are well-stirred. If we let <span class="process-math">\(x = x(t)\)</span> be the amount of salt in Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = y(t)\)</span> be the amount of salt in Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> then we know that</div>

<div class="para">We know that the salt concentrations in the two tanks are <span class="process-math">\(x/300\)</span> kilograms per liter and <span class="process-math">\(y/300\)</span> kilograms per liter.  Thus, we can describe the rate of change in each tank with a differential equation,</div>
