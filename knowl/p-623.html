<div class="para">In this scenario, you would devote most of your resources towards destroying mosquito breeding grounds. This would involve the permanent draining of a nearby marsh that is believed to be the primary breeding ground for mosquitoes at the construction site. Draining the marsh would take time to complete, delaying any impact on the mosquito population by two months, but would lower the carrying capacity to <span class="process-math">\(M_B\)</span> million mosquitoes. You would still spray insecticide but less frequently and with less potency than in Scenario A. It is estimated that spraying would immediately result in a value for <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(E_B.\)</span>
