<div class="para">Your final report should contain a one-page executive summary.  The executive summary should summarize your work for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/firstlook08-task-pharmacokinetics.html" title="Task 1.8.3.a: Pharmacokinetics of Malaria Chemoprophylaxis">Task 1.8.3.a</a> and  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/firstlook08-task-population-control.html" title="Task 1.8.3.b: Mosquito Population Control">Task 1.8.3.b</a> in such a way that the reader can rapidly become acquainted with the material. It should contain a brief description of the problem, important background information, a discussion of pertinent assumptions, a short description of your methodology, concise analysis, and your main conclusions. Assume the reader is familiar with the basics of calculus and differential equations, so there is no need to walk through every step of your solution process or include equations. However, you should still describe the processes and mathematical techniques you used to reach your conclusions and explain why you used them.  Refer the reader to the appendices as needed.</div>
