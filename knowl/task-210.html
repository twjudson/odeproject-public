<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/secondorder05-figure-gain.html" title="Figure 4.5.4">Figure 4.5.4</a> illustrates the power of differential equation modeling. For we can alter parameters in our equation and see the results in a physical (in this case electrical) system. Indeed, we see in this plot that for a capacitance of <span class="process-math">\(C = 0.0005\)</span> farads if we have an input voltage with a frequency around <span class="process-math">\(\omega = 45\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(44.7214\)</span> to be precise) then the gain is greatest. Optimization is a calculus problem and we merely have to take the derivative of gain with respect to <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> and find where it is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> All other frequencies give smaller gain for this particular capacitance. In fact, we can say that as we decrease our capacitance the optimal frequency; i.e., frequency which gives highest gain, decreases and we might want to look into this for a more exact relationship. We shall do that in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/secondorder05-task-tune-the-radio.html" title="Task 4.5.1.d: Tune the Radio">Task 4.5.1.d</a>.</div> <div class="para">Put another way, we see that if our input voltage has a specific frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{,}\)</span> there is a unique capacitance, <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> for this circuit that will maximize our gain. By changing <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> we can tune our circuit to maximize gain for a given input frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{.}\)</span> This is, in fact, how we tune a radio, for we change the capacitance of the radio's circuit so as to maximize the gain for the frequency (on our dial) that we wish to hear. So, the next time you try to find the station where Cousin Brucie is dedicating a Top Ten song from “Billie Bob” to “Sally May” know that a differential equation describes exactly what you are doing. How's that for cool?</div>
