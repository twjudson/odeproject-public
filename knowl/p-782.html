<div class="para">The constant <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a measure of the relative infectivity of the disease.  Some diseases such as Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever, are extremely infectious with a mortaility rate of up to 90%. On the other hand, AIDS which is caused by the HIV virus, has a much lower transmission rate.  The goal of this exercise is to examine the differences between the two.</div>
