<em class="emphasis">Choristoneura fumiferana</em> or the <em class="emphasis">eastern spruce budworm</em> is a species of moth native to the eastern United States and Canada. The caterpillars feed on the needles of spruce and fir trees. Populations can experience significant oscillations.  The spruce budworm population remains at a relatively low, constant level most of the time.  However, outbreaks have been recurring approximately every three decades, and studies suggest the spruce budworm has been breaking out in eastern North America for thousands of years.</div> <div class="para">Outbreaks of the spruce budworm have been responsible for some major deforestations in Canada and the United States.

<div class="para">Your final report should contain a one-page executive summary.  The executive summary should summarize your work in such a way that the reader can rapidly become acquainted with the material. It should contain a brief description of the problem, important background information, a discussion of pertinent assumptions, a short description of your methodology, concise analysis, and your main conclusions. Assume the reader is familiar with the basics of calculus and differential equations, so there is no need to walk through every step of your solution process or include equations. However, you should still describe the processes and mathematical techniques you used to reach your conclusions and explain why you used them.  Refer the reader to the appendices as needed.</div> <div class="para logical">
