<div class="para">Put another way, we see that if our input voltage has a specific frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{,}\)</span> there is a unique capacitance, <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> for this circuit that will maximize our gain. By changing <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> we can tune our circuit to maximize gain for a given input frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{.}\)</span> This is, in fact, how we tune a radio, for we change the capacitance of the radio's circuit so as to maximize the gain for the frequency (on our dial) that we wish to hear. So, the next time you try to find the station where Cousin Brucie is dedicating a Top Ten song from “Billie Bob” to “Sally May” know that a differential equation describes exactly what you are doing. How's that for cool?</div>
