The geometry for linear systems in three variables is a bit more complicated. For a system</div>

<div class="para">our solution curves live in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb R^3\text{,}\)</span> and there is simply a lot more room to move around in three dimensions than in two dimensions. The origin is still an equilibrium solution for a system of linear differential equations in three variables. The origin is a <dfn class="terminology">stable</dfn> equilibrium solution if any solution <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf x(t)\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf 0 = (0, 0, 0)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(t \to \infty\text{;}\)</span> otherwise, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf 0\)</span> is an <dfn class="terminology">unstable</dfn> equilibrium solution. In the case of planar systems, an unstable solution is a nodal saddle, a nodal source, a spiral source, or a source with a single unstable line. In the case of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb R^3\text{,}\)</span> we could have a <dfn class="terminology">stable line</dfn> of solutions and an <dfn class="terminology">unstable plane</dfn> of solutions. In this case, all solutions of the system with initial condition lying on the stable line would approach the origin as <span class="process-math">\(t \to \infty\text{,}\)</span> but all solutions with initial conditions that are a nonzero point on the unstable plane would move away from the origin.</div>
