Suppose that we have two tanks (<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>) between which a mixture of brine flows (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/systems04-figure-mixing-example.html" title="Figure 2.4.1">FigureÂ 2.4.1</a>). Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains 300 liters of water in which 100 kilograms of salt has been dissolved and Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> contains 300 liters of pure water. Fresh water is pumped into Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at the rate of 500 liters per hour, and brine is pumped into Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at the rate of 500 liters per hour. Brine is also drained at a rate 500 liters of brine per hour from Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> All brine mixtures are well-stirred.  If we let <span class="process-math">\(x = x(t)\)</span> be the amount of salt in Tank <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = y(t)\)</span> be the amount of salt in Tank <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> then we know that</div>
