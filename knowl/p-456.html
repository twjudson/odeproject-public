<div class="para">Pollution is an increasing concern in Lake Baikal. One of the major polluters has been Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill. The mill was constructed in 1966 on the shoreline of Lake Baikal and regularly discharged waste into the lake. The plant was closed in November 2008 due to unprofitability, but production resumed in January 2010. The mill underwent a final bankruptcy in September 2013, but the longterm fate of the mill is still undecided.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-13-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
