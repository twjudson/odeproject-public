<div class="para">Consider an epidemic that moves through an isolated population.  We will make the following assumptions about the epidemic.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Individuals are infected at a rate proportional to the product of the number of infected and susceptible individuals.  We assume that the constant of proportionality is <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The length of the incubation period is negligible, and infectious individuals are immediately infectious.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">On the average, an infected individual dies after 10 days.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Only a single individual is initially ill.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Infected individuals do not give birth, but susceptible individuals have a birth rate of 0.0003 per individual per year.  Newborns are susceptible.</div></li>

\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; = -\alpha SI + 0.0003S\tag{2.2.7}\\

<div class="para">The constant <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a measure of the relative infectivity of the disease.  Some diseases such as Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever, are extremely infectious with a mortaility rate of up to 90%. On the other hand, AIDS which is caused by the HIV virus, has a much lower transmission rate.  The goal of this exercise is to examine the differences between the two.</div>
