<div class="para">The primary prey for the Canadian lynx is the snowshoe hare. We will denote the population of hares by <span class="process-math">\(H(t)\)</span> and the population of lynx by <span class="process-math">\(L(t)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is the time measured in years. We will make the following assumptions for our predator-prey model.</div>

<div class="para">Since the lynx prey on the hares, we can argue that the rate at which the hares are consumed by the lynx is proportional to the rate at which the hares and lynx interact.  Thus, the equation that predicts the rate of change of the hare population becomes</div>

<div class="para">The lynx receive benefit from the hare population. The rate at which lynx are born is proportional to the number of hares that are eaten, and this is proportional to the rate at which the hares and lynx interact.

Notice that the predator population, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> begins to grow and reaches a peak after the prey population, <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> reaches its peak. As the prey population declines, the predator population also declines. Once the predator population is smaller, the prey population has a chance to recover, and the cycle begins again.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>
