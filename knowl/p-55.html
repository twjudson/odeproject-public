<div class="para">Like the influenza virus, the HIV-1 virus is an RNA virus. An RNA virus cannot reproduce on its own and must use the DNA from a host cell. To do this, the virus attaches itself to a CD4-positive T-helper cell and injects its RNA into the cell. This way the virus can use the T-cell's DNA to replicate itself using a process called reverse transcription, where a DNA copy of the virus's RNA is made. New virus particles are created, and the T-cell eventually bursts releasing the virions into the body. If we let <span class="process-math">\(T^*\)</span> be the concentration of infected T-cells, we can model this process with the following system of equations,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dT^*}{dt} &amp; =  kTV - \delta T^*\\
\frac{dV}{dt} &amp; =  N \delta T^* - cV,
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> is the rate of loss of the virus producing T-cells and <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is the number of virions produced per infected T-cell during its lifetime. The term <span class="process-math">\(kTV\)</span> tells us the rate at which the HIV-1 virus infects T-cells. This is the same idea as modeling how predators interact with prey in a predator-prey model. Thus, our complete model becomes</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dT}{dt} &amp; =  s + pT\left(1 - \frac{T}{T_{\text{max}}}  \right) - d_T T - kTV\\
\frac{dT^*}{dt} &amp; =  kTV - \delta T^*\\
\frac{dV}{dt} &amp; =  N \delta T^* - cV.
\end{align*}
