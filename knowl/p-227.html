<div class="para">We will now investigate how our circuit reacts under different voltage sources. For example, we might have a zero voltage source (the capacitor could still hold a charge). We could also have a constant nonzero source of voltage such as a battery or a fluctuating source of voltage such as a generator. We might even have a series of pulses of voltage where the current is periodically turned on and off. We would like to be able to understand the solutions to the equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/firstlook03-equation-rc-circuit.html" title="Equation 1.3.3">(1.3.3)</a> for different voltage sources <span class="process-math">\(E(t)\text{.}\)</span> If we view the differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/firstlook03-equation-rc-circuit.html" title="Equation 1.3.3">(1.3.3)</a> as an expression for computing how fast current is flowing across the capacitor, we can analyze our circuit from a geometric point of view and can actually say a great deal about circuits without solving a differential equation.</div>
