<div class="para">Lobsters are a family (Nephropidae, synonym Homaridae) of marine crustaceans. They have long bodies with muscular tails and live in crevices or burrows  on rocky, sandy, or muddy bottoms from the shoreline to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  Lobsters are omnivores and typically eat live prey such as fish, mollusks, other crustaceans, worms, and some plant life. They scavange if necessary.  Because lobsters live in murky environments at the bottom of the ocean, they mostly use their antennae as sensors. Lobsters can "smell" their food by using four small antennae on the front of their heads and tiny sensing hairs that cover their bodies.</div>
