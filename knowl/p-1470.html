<div class="para">Current, <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\text{,}\)</span> is the rate at which a charge flows through this circuit and is measured in amperes or amps. We assign a direction to the current, and a current flowing in the opposite direction will be given negative values. The impressed voltage, <span class="process-math">\(E(t)\text{,}\)</span> is measured in volts, the resistance <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is measured in ohms, and the capacitance <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is measured in farads. The charge on the capacitor <span class="process-math">\(Q(t)\)</span> at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in coulombs. Inductance on the coil, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> is measured in henrys.</div>
