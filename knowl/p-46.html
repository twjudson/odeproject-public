<div class="para">We have good historical data for the populations of the lynx and snowshoe hare from the Hudson Bay Company, the oldest company in North America. This large Canadian retail company, which owns and operates a large number of retail stores in North America and Europe, including Saks Fifth Avenue, was originally founded in 1670 as a fur trading company. The Hudson Bay Company kept accurate records on the number of lynx pelts that were bought from trappers from 1821 to 1940. The company noticed that the number of pelts varied from year to year and that the number of lynx pelts reached a peak about every ten years <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/elton-1942.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 11: Journal of Animal Ecology">[11]</a>. The ten year cycle for lynx can be best understood using a system of differential equations.</div>
