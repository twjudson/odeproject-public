<div class="para">Suppose that we have a large tank containing 1000 gallons of pure water and that water containing 0.5 pounds of salt per gallon flows into the tank at a rate of 10 gallons per minute.  If the tank is also draining at a rate of 10 gallons per minute, the water level in the tank will remain constant.  We will assume that the water in the tank is constantly stirred so that the mixture of salt and water is uniform in the tank.</div> <div class="para logical">
