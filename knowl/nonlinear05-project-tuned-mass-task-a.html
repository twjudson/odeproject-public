<div class="para">To construct a simple model of a tuned-mass damper, we will consider a mass, <span class="process-math">\(m_1\text{,}\)</span> connected to a fixed wall with a spring and a dashpot. To this first mass, we attach a second mass, <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{,}\)</span> by using a spring and a dashpot (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/nonlinear05-figure-nonlinear05-tmd.html" title="Figure 5.5.2">Figure 5.5.2</a>). Here the oscillator to be damped has mass <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> with spring or restoring constant <span class="process-math">\(k_1\)</span> and resistance or damping constant <span class="process-math">\(b_1\text{.}\)</span> This could be a large structure, where <span class="process-math">\(k_1\)</span> would be its stiffness while <span class="process-math">\(b_1\)</span> would reflect internal frictional resistance to motion proportional to the velocity of the structure. The damping oscillator would be a large mass which sits atop the structure and is permitted to slide or roll as the structure sways in response to wind or seismic forces. This damper has mass <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> with spring or restoring constant <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> and resistance or damping constant <span class="process-math">\(b_2\text{.}\)</span>
