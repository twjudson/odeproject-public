<li><div class="para">If we make a slight change in the system, then we might reasonably expect the phase portrait to change slightly. For example, a closed orbit might expand or contract, an equilibrium solution might shift, or a spiral source might tighten up, but we would not expect new equilibrium solutions to appear or a spiral source to turn into a spiral sink.  However, this may be exactly what happens. If such a change occurs in the system through an adjustment of a parameter, we say a <dfn class="terminology">bifurcation</dfn> has occurred.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">Hopf bifurcation</dfn> if an attracting periodic solution encircling an equilibrium solution develops as <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> passes through the bifurcation value.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\((x_0(\alpha), y_0(\alpha))\)</span> is a equilibrium solution for the family of systems<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = f_\alpha(x, y)\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = g_\alpha(x, y)

</div>parameterized by <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{,}\)</span> and the Jacobian matrix for the system evaluated at this equilibrium has eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(a(\alpha) \pm i b(\alpha)\text{.}\)</span> Assume that at some <span class="process-math">\(\alpha = \alpha_0\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(a(\alpha_0) = 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a'(\alpha_0) \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b(\alpha_0) \neq 0\text{,}\)</span> and that the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable. Then there exists an <span class="process-math">\(\alpha_1\)</span> such that the system has a periodic solution encircling the equilibrium solution for <span class="process-math">\(\alpha_0 \lt \alpha \lt \alpha_1\text{.}\)</span>

The constant <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is know as the <dfn class="terminology">satiation constant</dfn>.
