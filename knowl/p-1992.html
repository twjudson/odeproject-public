<div class="para">In 1963, an MIT professor, Edward N. Lorenz, published a paper on his research in meteorology. Using differential equations, Lorenz had developed a simplified system to model certain weather-related phenomena.  When he analyzed the system, however, he found that the trajectories of the solutions were incredibly convoluted and effectively unpredictable for certain parameters. The <dfn class="terminology">Lorenz equations</dfn> can be written as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = -\sigma x + \sigma y\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = \rho x - y - xz\\
\frac{dz}{dt} &amp; = -\beta z + xy,
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\rho\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> are constants. The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for systems of differential equations guarantees a unique solution for each set of initial conditions,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
x(0) &amp; = x_0\\
y(0) &amp; = y_0\\
z(0) &amp; = z_0.
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">However, Lorenz discovered that the trajectories of the solutions were incredibly convoluted and effectively unpredictable for certain parameters. For certain values of <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\rho\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{,}\)</span> the trajectories are  extremely sensitive to initial conditions. Since real data always has some inherent uncertainty, initial values are never precisely known, and we may have little success modeling real world phenomena. In addition, solutions can stay in a bounded region of the three dimensional version of the phase plane and wind through the region along an incredibly convoluted path. There is much more freedom to move around in three dimensions than there is in two.</div>
