<div class="para">Just as numerical algorithms are useful when finding the roots of polynomials, numerical methods will prove very useful in our study of ordinary differential equations. Consider the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^2 - 2\text{.}\)</span>  We do not need a numerical algorithm to see that the roots of this polynomial are <span class="process-math">\(x = \sqrt{2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = - \sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span> However, a numerical method such as the Newton-Raphson Algorithm is very useful for approximating <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> as a decimal.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-12-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> Similarly, it may be easier to generate a numerical solution for differential equations if our goal is simply to plot a solution. In addition, there will be differential equations for which it is impossible to find a solution in terms of elementary functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions.</div>
