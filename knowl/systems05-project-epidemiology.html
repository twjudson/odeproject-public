<div class="para">On December 31, 2019, the city of Wuhan in China reported an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is the seventh member of the coronavirus family, together with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, that can spread to humans.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-28-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> The virus is spreading rapidly. As of January 10, 2021, over 89 million people worldwide have been infected, including over 1.9 million deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak as a pandemic.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-29-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>

An epidemic is specific to one city, region, or country, but a pandemic spreads beyond national borders, possibly worldwide. The 1918 Spanish flu was the worst pandemic in modern human history. It infected 500 million people around the world and resulted in the deaths of over 50 million people.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-30-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> Increased travel and mobility have increased the likelihood of new diseases spreading. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/systems-table-pandemics.html" title="Table 2.5.1: Major epidemics and pandemics in human history">Table 2.5.1</a> lists the major epidemics and pandemics that have occurred over time.

<div class="para">The basic reproduction number <span class="process-math">\(R_0\text{,}\)</span> is introduced to measure the transmission potential of a disease.

For many infections, there is an incubation period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in class E (for exposed), leading to the SEIR model. The SEIS model is like the SEIR except that no immunity is acquired at the end. In the E class, a significant number of persons may never develop symptoms, but they are capable of transmitting the disease, introducing an additional compartment A, and thus SEAIR. For many infections, such as measles, babies are not born into the susceptible compartment but are immune to the disease for the first few months of life due to protection from maternal antibodies. The M class contains infants with maternally derived immunity (or passive immunity). The MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR, but the immunity in the R class would be temporary, so that individuals would regain their susceptibility when the temporary immunity ended.</div></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="systems05.html#systems05-project-epidemiology" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
