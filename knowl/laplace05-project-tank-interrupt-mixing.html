<div class="introduction"><div class="para">Water containing 2 kg of salt per liter (L) is poured into a tank at a rate of 1 L/min, and the well-stirred mixture leaves at the same rate. After 10 min, the process is stopped and fresh water is poured into the tank at a rate of 1 L/min, with the new mixture leaving at 1 L/min. We seek to model this situation in order to determine the amount (kg) of salt in the tank at the end of 20 minutes if there were 100 L of pure water initially in the tank.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-50-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
