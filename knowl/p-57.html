<div class="para">In this section we have provided a general notion of what a differential equation is as well as several modeling situations where differential equations are useful; however, we have left many questions unanswered.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Can we find a more rigorous definition of a differential equation?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What is the proper way to define a system of differential equations?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Does a differential equation or a system of differential equations always have a solution?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Are solutions to differential equations unique?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If a unique solution to a differential equation exists, can we find it? If it is not possible to find a precise solution algebraically, can we estimate the solution numerically? If neither is possible, can we still say anything useful about the solution?</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">Of course, other questions will come to mind as we continue our study of differential equations.</div>
