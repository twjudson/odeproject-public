<div class="para">Your company has been contracted to build a hospital in sub-Saharan Africa. The company is aware of the malaria threat in the region and has asked you to analyze malaria preventive measures for the employees that will be sent to build the hospital.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-18-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
</div> <div class="para">Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease. In 2018, it was estimated that 228 million people worldwide contracted malaria.  The estimated number of deaths was approximately 405,000 people. Children under the age of 5 years are the most vulnerable group, and they accounted for 67% (272,000) of all malaria deaths worldwide. Ninety-three percent of malaria cases are in Africa with six countries accounting or more than half of all malaria cases worldwide: Nigeria (25%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Uganda (5%), and Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique and Niger (4% each).<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-19-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>
</div> <div class="para">People who get malaria are typically very sick with high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. Although malaria can be a deadly disease, illness and death from malaria can usually be prevented. The disease is caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells. The parasite is transmitted from person to person through the bite of mosquitoes. Avoiding mosquito bites is the only sure method to prevent malaria infection. Malaria can be cured with prescription drugs. The type of drugs and length of treatment depend on the type of malaria, where the person was infected, their age, whether they are pregnant, and how sick they are at the start of treatment.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-20-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>

</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Your first task is to analyze the anti-malarial drug dosing regimen for those building the hospital. The primary concerns are how soon to start treatment before everyone arrives and the potential risks if employees miss one or two of their scheduled doses. These questions require an understanding of pharmacokinetics.</div> <div class="para">Pharmacokinetics is the study of what the body does to a drug. Specifically, it refers to the movement of the drug into, through, and out of the body. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of a drug allows medical professionals to develop appropriate drug dosing regimens for their patients.  A complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics of a drug requires information on the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolization, and excretion of the drug from the body. In order to simplify this problem, we will assume that the anti-malarial medication is immediately absorbed into the blood stream and that everyone begins treatment with zero anti-malarial medication in their body. After the drug is absorbed into the blood, the rate of elimination of the drug from the body is proportional to the amount of drug currently in the blood. In other words, the more of the drug in the blood stream, the faster it is removed from the body. We will also assume that the rate of excretion of the drug is the same for everyone.</div> <div class="para">Atovaquone/proguanil, sold under the trade names Malarone among others, is a combination of two antimalarial medication atovaquone and proguanil. It is used to treat and prevent malaria, including chloroquine-resistant malaria.  A standard adult pill of Malarone contains 250mg of atovaquone and 100mg of proguanil. A typical dose is one pill taken at the same time each day. An individual must maintain at least 300mg of atovaquone and 30mg of proguanil in their blood at all times in order to prevent contracting malaria. A typical adult eliminates atovaquone at a rate that corresponds to a half-life (time to eliminate one half of the original dose) of 48 hours. The half-life of proguanil is 12 hours.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-21-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>

</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Unfortunately anti-malarial drugs are not 100% effective at preventing the spread of malaria. The only sure method to prevent contracting malaria is to avoid mosquito bites. In light of this, you must look at methods to control the mosquito population in the construction area near the living quarters. Your objective is to reduce the mosquito population in both the short (less than 6 months) and long (greater than 6 months) term while also minimizing the environmental impact and potential health problems associated with the mosquito control measures that are implemented.</div> <div class="para">There are two typical approaches to mosquito control. The first approach is to directly kill mosquitoes using an insecticide spray. The effectiveness of this method depends on the frequency of spraying and the concentration of the insecticide. However, frequent spraying of insecticide has potential negative health effects on both humans and nearby wildlife. This method is also temporary as the mosquito population will recover once routine spraying has stopped. The second approach to mosquito population control is to eliminate the resources that support the mosquito population. This is done through the destruction of mosquito breeding grounds and involves everything from filling in small puddles to the draining of swamps and marshes. Keeping in consideration manpower and budget constraints, you must find the combination of these two approaches that best meets these objectives over the next six months.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Studies on mosquito control indicate that the rate of change of the mosquito population, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> (measured in millions of mosquitoes) in the area can be accurately modeled using the following Initial Value Problem:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = kP \left( 1 - \frac{P}{M} \right) - EP, \quad P(0) = P_0,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is a constant that represents the effectiveness of insecticide spraying efforts, M is the local carrying capacity and is affected by efforts to reduce mosquito breeding grounds, <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the population growth constant, <span class="process-math">\(P_0\)</span> is the initial population, and time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in months. Current estimates suggest that there are approximately 10 million mosquitoes living near the proposed site of the hospital. Data indicates that <span class="process-math">\(M = 11\)</span> million and <span class="process-math">\(k = 1.2\)</span> for this mosquito population.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Use the information provided and the RK4 method to evaluate the following three mosquito population scenarios. Recommend a scenario and support your recommendation with mathematics. Be sure to include other considerations (not just what your mathematical model tells you) in your analysis. Tables, graphs, and other visual representations that summarize and support your analysis and recommendation are encouraged and should be included in an appendix.</div>
