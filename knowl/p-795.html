<div class="para">Large mobile cranes can reach up to 700 feet (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/systems03-figure-cranes.html" title="Figure 2.3.1">FigureÂ 2.3.1</a>). This is about the same height as a 50 story building. At such heights, cranes are susceptible to winds and the end of the boom can move back and forth several feet even in moderate winds. We can model the motion as a harmonic oscillator if the side-to-side motion is not too great. However, if the wind becomes too strong and the crane moves too much, gravity will become a factor and the crane may topple due to its weight.</div>
