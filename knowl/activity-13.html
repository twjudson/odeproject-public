<div class="introduction"><div class="para">The chukar partridge, or simply chukar, is a upland gamebird in the pheasant family. Originally native to Asia and ranging from the eastern Mediterranean to Himalayas, the chukar has been widely introduced as an upland game bird with populations now established in the United States, Canada, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand and Hawaii. One particularly good area for hunting chukar is the western Great Basin area of the U.S. (eastern Oregon and Washington and western Idaho).</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Suppose that the population of chukar on a private game ranch in eastern Oregon grows logisitically.  Estimates tell us that the one hundred square mile ranch and that the ranch can support at most <span class="process-math">\(120\)</span> birds per square mile. The growth rate of the chukar population is estimated to be <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> birds per year. Model the growth of the chukar population with an initial value problem.</div> </article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Suppose that hunting on the ranch is restricted to guests and the average guest harvest <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> chukars per visit. Modify the model in part (a) to take into account the effect that hunting has on the chukar population.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">What is the maximum number of guests that the ranch can accommodate and still maintain a healthy population of game birds? How many chukar per square mile would be needed to allow this many guests?</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="firstlook07.html#activity-13" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
