<div class="para">The word “pandemic” comes from the Greek word “pandemos,” meaning “pertaining to all people.”  Pandemics are usually caused by an infectious agent that is capable of rapidly spreading. An epidemic is specific to one city, region, or country, but a pandemic spreads beyond national borders, possibly worldwide. The 1918 Spanish flu was the worst pandemic in modern human history. It infected 500 million people around the world and resulted in the deaths of over 50 million people.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-30-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> Increased travel and mobility have increased the likelihood of new diseases spreading. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/systems-table-pandemics.html" title="Table 2.5.1: Major epidemics and pandemics in human history">Table 2.5.1</a> lists the major epidemics and pandemics that have occurred over time.
