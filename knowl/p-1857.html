<div class="para">While pendulums have long been used in clocks to keep time, they have also been used to measure gravity as well as used in early seismometers to measure the effect of earthquakes. One of the more interesting uses of a pendulum has been to measure the rotation of the earth. In 1851, the French physicist, Léon Foucault, used a pendulum (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/nonlinear02-figure-fouclault.html" title="Figure 5.2.1">Figure 5.2.1</a>) to demonstrate that the earth actually rotated on its axis. The fact that the earth rotates had been known for a long time, but Foucault's experiment gave the first simple proof of this phenomena.</div>
