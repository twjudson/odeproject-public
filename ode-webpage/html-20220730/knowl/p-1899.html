<p>The 60-story, 790-foot mirror-glass John Hancock Tower, New England's tallest building, was completed in 1976 and was designed by Henry N. Cobb, who founded the firm Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners with famed architect I.M. Pei. (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/nonlinear05-figure-john-hancock-tower.html" title="Figure 5.5.1">Figure 5.5.1</a>).<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-47-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> The building suffered many problems during construction, the most notorious of which was how the original glass windows were attached. In early 1972 when construction was still underway, one of the 500-pound windows popped out of the building and committed suicide on the sidewalk below. In all, more than 100 of the building's windows suffered the same fate. Fortunately, no one was injured. Initially, the architects and engineers thought that the problem was caused by the building's tendancy to sway excessively in high winds. However, they later determined that the falling-window problem was caused by the air space between the double-paned windows and pressure differentials between the interior and exterior of the building. The problem was solved by replacing all of the windows  with single sheets of fully tempered glass. During the repairs, the windows were replaced with plywood, and the building was nicknamed the “Plywood Palace.”</p>
