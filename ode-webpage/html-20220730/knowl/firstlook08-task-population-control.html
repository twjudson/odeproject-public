</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<p>Unfortunately anti-malarial drugs are not 100% effective at preventing the spread of malaria. The only sure method to prevent contracting malaria is to avoid mosquito bites. In light of this, you must look at methods to control the mosquito population in the construction area near the living quarters. Your objective is to reduce the mosquito population in both the short (less than 6 months) and long (greater than 6 months) term while also minimizing the environmental impact and potential health problems associated with the mosquito control measures that are implemented.</p>
<p>There are two typical approaches to mosquito control. The first approach is to directly kill mosquitoes using an insecticide spray. The effectiveness of this method depends on the frequency of spraying and the concentration of the insecticide. However, frequent spraying of insecticide has potential negative health effects on both humans and nearby wildlife. This method is also temporary as the mosquito population will recover once routine spraying has stopped. The second approach to mosquito population control is to eliminate the resources that support the mosquito population. This is done through the destruction of mosquito breeding grounds and involves everything from filling in small puddles to the draining of swamps and marshes. Keeping in consideration manpower and budget constraints, you must find the combination of these two approaches that best meets these objectives over the next six months.</p>
<p>Studies on mosquito control indicate that the rate of change of the mosquito population, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> (measured in millions of mosquitoes) in the area can be accurately modeled using the following Initial Value Problem:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = kP \left( 1 - \frac{P}{M} \right) - EP, \quad P(0) = P_0,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is a constant that represents the effectiveness of insecticide spraying efforts, M is the local carrying capacity and is affected by efforts to reduce mosquito breeding grounds, <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the population growth constant, <span class="process-math">\(P_0\)</span> is the initial population, and time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in months. Current estimates suggest that there are approximately 10 million mosquitoes living near the proposed site of the hospital. Data indicates that <span class="process-math">\(M = 11\)</span> million and <span class="process-math">\(k = 1.2\)</span> for this mosquito population.</p>
<p>Use the information provided and the RK4 method to evaluate the following three mosquito population scenerios. Recommend a scenerio and support your recommendation with mathematics. Be sure to include other considerations (not just what your mathematical model tells you) in your analysis. Tables, graphs, and other visual representations that summarize and support your analysis and recommendation are encouraged and should be included in an appendix.</p>

</h5>
<p>In this scenerio, you would devote most of your available resources for mosquito control to the use of insecticide. You would spray highly concentrated and expensive insecticide in the employee living areas daily. Due to the emphasis on the use of insecticide would be limited to destroying small mosquito breeding grounds only on the base camp. You estimate a value for <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(E_A\)</span> (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/firstlook08-table-mosquito.html" title="Table 1.8.2: Values for M and E">Table 1.8.2</a>) and a new carrying capacity of <span class="process-math">\(M_A\)</span> million mosquitoes that would be in effect immediately.</p>

</h5>
<p>In this scenerio, you would devote most of your resources towards destroying mosquito breeding grounds. This would involve the permanent draining of a nearby marsh that is believed to be the primary breeding ground for mosquitoes at the construction site. Draining the marsh would take time to complete, delaying any impact on the mosquito population by two months, but would lower the carrying capacity to <span class="process-math">\(M_B\)</span> million mosquitoes. You would still spray insecticide but less frequently and with less potency than in Scenerio A. It is estimated that spraying would immediately result in a value for <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(E_B.\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading">

</h5>
<p>This scenerio seeks to balance the insecticide and breeding ground destruction approaches. You would use the same, more potent, insecticide as Scenerio A but spray less frequently. This would free up manpower to destroy small mosquito breeding grounds. You estimate a new value for <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(E_C\)</span> and a new carrying capacity of <span class="process-math">\(M_C\)</span> million mosquitoes that would be in effect immediately.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="firstlook08.html#firstlook08-task-population-control" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
