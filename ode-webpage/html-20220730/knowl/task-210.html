<div class="introduction">
<p>In our study of phase angle representation in the previous section we saw that the <span class="process-math">\(\sin(\omega t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos(\omega t)\)</span> terms of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/secondorder05-equation-steady-state.html" title="Equation 4.5.4">(4.5.4)</a>  can be combined into one sine term (albeit with a phase angle) with one amplitude,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/secondorder05-equation-steady-state.html">
\begin{equation}
\text{Amplitude}(y_{\text{steady state}}) = R \sqrt{\frac{C^{2} \omega^{2}}{C^{2} L^{2} \omega^{4} + {\left(C^{2} R^{2} - 2 \, C L\right)} \omega^{2} + 1}}.\tag{4.5.9}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Thus, our gain (recall, gain is the ratio of the amplitude of the steady state output voltage, <span class="process-math">\(V_{\text{out}}\text{,}\)</span> to the amplitude of the input voltage, <span class="process-math">\(V_{\text{in}}\)</span>) is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/secondorder05-equation-steady-state.html">
\begin{equation*}
\text{gain} = R \sqrt{\frac{C^{2} \omega^{2}}{C^{2} L^{2} \omega^{4} + {\left(C^{2} R^{2} - 2 \, C L\right)} \omega^{2} + 1}}.

<p class="continuation">Here, <span class="process-math">\(V_{\text{in}} = 1\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(E(t) = \sin(\omega t)\)</span> and has amplitude <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> which is a function of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{.}\)</span> Gain is a measure of the response of the circuit to input voltage <span class="process-math">\(E(t)\text{,}\)</span> which in this case is <span class="process-math">\(E(t) = \sin(\omega t)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Let us fix <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> ohm and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> henry and see what gain is in this case as a function of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> over a range of <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> values. Let us “tune” this circuit by changing <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> the size of the capacitance in the circuit and see how gain changes as input voltage frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{,}\)</span> changes.</p>

For we can alter parameters in our equation and see the results in a physical (in this case electrical) system. Indeed, we see in this plot that for a capacitance of <span class="process-math">\(C = 0.0005\)</span> farads if we have an input voltage with a frequency around <span class="process-math">\(\omega = 45\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(44.7214\)</span> to be precise) then the gain is greatest. Optimization is a calculus problem and we merely have to take the derivative of gain with respect to <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> and find where it is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> All other frequencies give smaller gain for this particular capacitance. In fact, we can say that as we decrease our capacitance the optimal frequency; i.e., frequency which gives highest gain, decreases and we might want to look into this for a more exact relationship. We shall do that in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/secondorder05-task-tune-the-radio.html" title="Task 4.5.1.d: Tune the Radio">Task 4.5.1.d</a>.</p>
<p>Put another way, we see that if our input voltage has a specific frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{,}\)</span> there is a unique capacitance, <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> for this circuit that will maximize our gain. By changing <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> we can tune our circuit to maximize gain for a given input frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{.}\)</span> This is, in fact, how we tune a radio, for we change the capacitance of the radio's circuit so as to maximize the gain for the frequency (on our dial) that we wish to hear. So, the next time you try to find the station where Cousin Brucie is dedicating a Top Ten song from “Billie Bob” to “Sally May” know that a differential equation describes exactly what you are doing. How's that for cool?</p>

<p>Use your understanding of RLC circuits to show for an imposed <span class="process-math">\(E(t) = \sin(\omega t)\)</span> on the RLC circuit given by</p>

<p class="continuation">the maximum gain is obtained when <span class="process-math">\(\omega = 1/\sqrt{LC}\)</span> and thus we could tune our radio by changing the inductance <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as well, if that were as convenient as changing the capacitance, which it is not. So let us stick to tuning by changing the capacitance <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span></p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="secondorder05.html#task-210" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
