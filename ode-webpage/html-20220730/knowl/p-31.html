<p>We can modify the logistic growth model to understand how a population with a minimum threshold grows. The black rhinoceros, once the most numerous of all rhinoceros species, is now critically endangered. The black rhino, native to eastern and southern Africa, was estimated to have a population of about <span class="process-math">\(100{,}000\)</span> around 1900. Because of hunting, habitat changes, competing species, and most of all illegal poaching, the number of black rhinos today is estimated to be below <span class="process-math">\(3000\text{.}\)</span> If the wild population becomes too low, the animals may not be able to find suitable mates and the black rhino will become extinct. There must be a minimum population for the species to survive.  Suppose that this minimum or threshold population for the black rhino is <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> animals and that remaining habitant in Africa will support no more that <span class="process-math">\(20{,}000\)</span> rhinos. How might we model the current population, <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\)</span> of black rhinos?</p>
