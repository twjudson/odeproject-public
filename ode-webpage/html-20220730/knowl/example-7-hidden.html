<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Suppose that we have a large tank containing 1000 gallons of pure water and that water containing 0.5 pounds of salt per gallon flows into the tank at a rate of 10 gallons per minute.  If the tank is also draining at a rate of 10 gallons per minute, the water level in the tank will remain constant.  We will assume that the water in the tank is constantly stirred so that the mixture of salt and water is uniform in the tank.</p>
<p>We can model the amount of salt in the tank using differential equations. If <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> is the amount of salt in the tank at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> then the rate at which the salt is changing in the tank is the difference between the rate at which salt is flowing into the tank and the rate at which it is leaving the tank, or</p>

\begin{equation}
\frac{dx}{dt} = \text{rate in} - \text{rate out}.\tag{1.2.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Of course, the salt flows into the tank at the rate of <span class="process-math">\(10 \cdot 0.5 = 5\)</span> pounds of salt per minute. However, the rate at which the salt leaves the tank depends on <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\text{,}\)</span> the amount salt in the tank at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>  At time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> there is <span class="process-math">\(x(t)/1000\)</span> pounds of salt in one gallon. Therefore, salt flows out of the tank at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(10x(t)/1000 = x(t)/100\)</span> pounds per minute. Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/firstlook02-equation-mixing-problem.html" title="Equation 1.2.2">(1.2.2)</a> now becomes</p>

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{500 - x} = \frac{dt}{100}.

<p class="continuation">Integrating both sides of the equation, we have</p>
