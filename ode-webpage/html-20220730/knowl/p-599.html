<p>You have been retained as a consultant to the  United States Coast Guard (USCG) to analyze this data and submit a report of your findings.  Your final report should contain a one-page executive summary.  The executive summary should summarize your work in such a way that the reader can rapidly become acquainted with the material. It should contain a brief description of the problem, important background information, a discussion of pertinent assumptions, a short description of your methodology, concise analysis, and your main conclusions. Do not assume that the reader knows anything about calculus or differential equations, but does have experts that can verify your model and calculations, which should appear in an appendix.</p>
