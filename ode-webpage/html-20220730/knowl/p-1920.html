<p>Of course, <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k_1\)</span> involve the building and are set by the architects and engineers. We, however, are free to choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> We want to choose <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> fairly large so that there is a rapid loss of energy; i.e., the magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(dH/dt\)</span> is large.  We should choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> large enough so that this mass oscillates with respect to <span class="process-math">\(m_1\text{.}\)</span> If we choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> two small, then the strong damper will almost serve as a rigid connection between <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, we wish to choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> to be large so that we guaranteed that this mass will oscillate with respect to  <span class="process-math">\(m_1\text{.}\)</span>  We should, however, remember that <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> is sitting on top of a very tall building. Finally, we should choose <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> to maximize the rate at which the second mass oscillates with respect to the first and to maximize the oscillations of <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{.}\)</span> If we choose <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> so that the second spring is in resonance with the first, the oscillations of the first mass force the second at its resonance frequency. Thus, we will have relatively large oscillations of the second mass and a large loss of energy.</p>
