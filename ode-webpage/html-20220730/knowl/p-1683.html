<p>The Millennium Bridge, the first new bridge to span the Thames River in London in over 100 years, is a modern example of how resonance can effect a bridge (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/secondorder04-figure-millennium-bridge.html" title="Figure 4.4.1">Figure 4.4.1</a>). This pedestrian bridge, which opened to the public in June 2000, was quickly closed after the bridge experienced high amplitude horizontal oscillations during periods of high traffic. Studies by designers found that the bridge experienced high amplitude horizontal oscillations in response to horizontal forcing at a rate of one cycle per second. Typically, people walk at a rate of two steps per second, so the time between two successive steps of the left foot is about one second. Thus, if people were to walk in cadence, they could set up strong horizontal forcing that would place a destructive load on the bridge. The engineers did not envision this to be a problem since tourists do not generally march in time. However, a video of tourists crossing the bridge revealed the opposite.  When the bridge began oscillating, people tended to walk in cadence in order to keep their balance (<a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQK21572oSU" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQK21572oSU</code></a>).</p>
