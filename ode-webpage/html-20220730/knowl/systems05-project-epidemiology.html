<div class="introduction">
<p>On December 31, 2019, the city of Wuhan in China reported an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is the seventh member of the coronavirus family, together with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, that can spread to humans.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-28-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> The virus is spreading rapidly. As of January 10, 2021, over 89 million people worldwide have been infected, including over 1.9 million deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak as a pandemic.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-29-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a></p>
<p>The word “pandemic” comes from the Greek word “pandemos,” meaning “pertaining to all people.”  Pandemics are usually caused by an infectious agent that is capable of rapidly spreading. An epidemic is specific to one city, region, or country, but a pandemic spreads beyond national borders, possibly worldwide. The 1918 Spanish flu was the worst pandemic in modern human history. It infected 500 million people around the world and resulted in the deaths of over 50 million people.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-30-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> Increased travel and mobility have increased the likelihood of new diseases spreading. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/systems-table-pandemics.html" title="Table 2.5.1: Major epidemics and pandemics in human history">Table 2.5.1</a> lists the major epidemics and pandemics that have occurred over time. The recent ones are SARS, swine flu, Ebola, MERS, and COVID-19.</p>

</table></div></figure><p>Infectious disease modeling is an essential part of the effort to minimize the spread. A well-designed model not only can help predict the likely course of an epidemic, but also can reveal the most promising and realistic strategies for containing it.</p>
<p>Following the SIR model in <a href="systems01.html#systems01-subsection-epidemics" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.1.3: Modeling Epidemics">Subsection 2.1.3</a>, we will assume that we have a closed population of size <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> where immigration, emigration, and birth do not play an important role. We will also ignore any deaths that are not related to our disease.</p>
<p>We will assume that each individual in the population falls into one of the following categories:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
s(t) \amp = \text{Susceptible individuals}\\
i(t) \amp = \text{Infected individuals}\\
r(t) \amp = \text{Removed individuals}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Susceptible individuals are those who do not yet have the disease and can catch the disease from infected individuals. Individuals enter the removed population by either recovering from the disease or dying. If an infected individual recovers, then the individual is immune to the disease. Schematically, we can represent the effect of the disease by the diagram</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
s \longrightarrow i \longrightarrow r.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since the population is closed, we know that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = N.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It may seem more natural to work with population counts, but some of our calculations will be simpler if we use the fractions instead. Therefore, we normalize the dependent variables by the total population to represent the fraction of the total population in each group. The two sets of dependent variables are proportional to each other, so either set will give us the same information about the progress of the epidemic</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
S(t) \amp = s(t)/N = \text{the fraction of susceptible individuals}\\
I(t) \amp = i(t)/N = \text{the fraction of infected individuals}\\
R(t) \amp = r(t)/N = \text{the fraction of removed individuals}\\
1 \amp = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The SIR model is  described by the nonlinear system of below, where <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">transmission rate</dfn> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">recovery rate</dfn>.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \alpha SI\\
\frac{dI}{dt} \amp = \alpha SI - \beta I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \beta I.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>To understand this model, let us analyze the differential equations and parameters. The transmission rate <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the product of two factors: the rate of contact and probability of transmission. <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> describes the fraction of those contacts that may result in infection, or it can be interpreted as the expected number of people an infected person infects per day. The function <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(I) = \alpha I\)</span> is the rate at which susceptible individuals become infectious, called the <dfn class="terminology">force of infection</dfn>. The rate of change of the susceptible population is negative the force of infection times the number of susceptible, leading to <span class="process-math">\(dS/dt =  - \alpha SI\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The recovery rate <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> is the rate at which infected individuals get over the disease, that is the proportion of infected recovering per day, thus the rate of change of the recovered population is <span class="process-math">\(\beta I\text{,}\)</span> leading to <span class="process-math">\(dR/dt = \beta I\text{.}\)</span> Importantly, the parameter <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> is measured in <span class="process-math">\(1/\text{time}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1/\beta\)</span> can be interpreted as the average time to recover, or the number of days an infected person has and can spread the disease.</p>
<p>The equation <span class="process-math">\(dI/dt = \alpha SI - \beta I\)</span> now makes sense.  The rate at which the fraction of infected individuals changes is the rate at which the fraction of susceptible minus the rate at which the fraction of individuals recover or</p>

<div class="introduction">
<p>The basic reproduction number <span class="process-math">\(R_0\text{,}\)</span> is introduced to measure the transmission potential of a disease. It is the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infective. For example, if the <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> for measles in a population is 16, then we would expect each new case of measles to produce 16 new secondary cases over the period of time during which the infected individual can actually spread the disease. The reproduction number is affected by several factors: the rate of contacts in the host population, the probability of infection being transmitted during contact, and the duration of infectiousness.

If <span class="process-math">\(R_0 \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> on average, an infected person infects less than one person. The disease is expected to stop spreading.

If <span class="process-math">\(R_0 \gt 1\text{,}\)</span> on average, an infected person infects more than one person. The disease is expected to increasingly spread in the absence of intervention.

<p>You have been commissioned to write a report on the COVID-19 pandemic to the state health department.  In particular, your task is to explain what the meaning of <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> and its relationship to “herd immunity”.  Your final report should contain a one-page executive summary.  The executive summary should summarize your work in such a way that the reader can rapidly become acquainted with the material. It should contain a brief description of the problem, important background information, a discussion of pertinent assumptions, a short description of your methodology, concise analysis, and your main conclusions. Assume the reader is familiar with the basics of calculus and differential equations, so there is no need to walk through every step of your solution process or include equations. However, you should still describe the processes and mathematical techniques you used to reach your conclusions and explain why you used them.  Refer the reader to the appendices as needed.</p>
<p>Appendices should be neatly formatted and present information in a logical manner. <em class="emphasis">DO NOT</em> simply print out Sage code.

</ul></article><div class="conclusion"><p>Other models include SEIR, SEIS, SEAIR, MSIR, MSEIR, and MSEIRS. For many infections, there is an incubation period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in class E (for exposed), leading to the SEIR model. The SEIS model is like the SEIR except that no immunity is acquired at the end. In the E class, a significant number of persons may never develop symptoms, but they are capable of transmitting the disease, introducing an additional compartment A, and thus SEAIR. For many infections, such as measles, babies are not born into the susceptible compartment but are immune to the disease for the first few months of life due to protection from maternal antibodies. The M class contains infants with maternally derived immunity (or passive immunity). The MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR, but the immunity in the R class would be temporary, so that individuals would regain their susceptibility when the temporary immunity ended.</p></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="systems05.html#systems05-project-epidemiology" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
