<div class="introduction">
<p>The 60-story, 790-foot mirror-glass John Hancock Tower, New England's tallest building, was completed in 1976 and was designed by Henry N. Cobb, who founded the firm Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners with famed architect I.M. Pei. (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/nonlinear05-figure-john-hancock-tower.html" title="Figure 5.5.1">Figure 5.5.1</a>).<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-47-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> The building suffered many problems during construction, the most notorious of which was how the original glass windows were attached. In early 1972 when construction was still underway, one of the 500-pound windows popped out of the building and committed suicide on the sidewalk below. In all, more than 100 of the building's windows suffered the same fate. Fortunately, no one was injured. Initially, the architects and engineers thought that the problem was caused by the building's tendancy to sway excessively in high winds. However, they later determined that the falling-window problem was caused by the air space between the double-paned windows and pressure differentials between the interior and exterior of the building. The problem was solved by replacing all of the windows  with single sheets of fully tempered glass. During the repairs, the windows were replaced with plywood, and the building was nicknamed the “Plywood Palace.”</p>

In fact, office workers in the upper stories of the building complained of motion sickness. The building actually twisted as it was swaying back and forth. Engineers determined that the building's natural sway period was dangerously close to the period of its torsion. To remedy the problem, the engineers installed a pair of tuned mass dampers on the 58th floor of the building to absorb the energy created by the swaying. This is the floor of concrete that you see near the top of the structure (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/nonlinear05-figure-john-hancock-tower.html" title="Figure 5.5.1">Figure 5.5.1</a>). In addition, 1,500 tons of steel braces were installed to keep the building from falling over in a high wind.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-48-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.5.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a></p>

<p>To construct a simple model of a tuned-mass damper, we will consider a mass, <span class="process-math">\(m_1\text{,}\)</span> connected to a fixed wall with a spring and a dashpot. To this first mass, we attach a second mass, <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{,}\)</span> by using a spring and a dashpot (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/nonlinear05-figure-nonlinear05-tmd.html" title="Figure 5.5.2">Figure 5.5.2</a>). Here the oscillator to be damped has mass <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> with spring or restoring constant <span class="process-math">\(k_1\)</span> and resistance or damping constant <span class="process-math">\(b_1\text{.}\)</span> This could be a large structure, where <span class="process-math">\(k_1\)</span> would be its stiffness while <span class="process-math">\(b_1\)</span> would reflect internal frictional resistance to motion proportional to the velocity of the structure. The damping oscillator would be a large mass which sits atop the structure and is permitted to slide or roll as the structure sways in response to wind or seismic forces. This damper has mass <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> with spring or restoring constant <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> and resistance or damping constant <span class="process-math">\(b_2\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>In our study here we will first presume an “ideal” structure with no resistance or damping coefficient; i.e., <span class="process-math">\(b_1 = 0\text{,}\)</span> and the same for the damper; i.e., <span class="process-math">\(b_2 = 0\text{.}\)</span> As we can see there is a driving force applied to the structure of <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = \rho_0 \cos(\omega t)\text{.}\)</span> Our interest will be in seeing if we can tune the added mass damper to reduce or eliminate the possibility of resonance when the initial structure is driven by a force with a frequency equal to that of the natural frequency of the initial mass system.</p>

We, however, are free to choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> We want to choose <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> fairly large so that there is a rapid loss of energy; i.e., the magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(dH/dt\)</span> is large.  We should choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> large enough so that this mass oscillates with respect to <span class="process-math">\(m_1\text{.}\)</span> If we choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> two small, then the strong damper will almost serve as a rigid connection between <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, we wish to choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> to be large so that we guaranteed that this mass will oscillate with respect to  <span class="process-math">\(m_1\text{.}\)</span>  We should, however, remember that <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> is sitting on top of a very tall building. Finally, we should choose <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> to maximize the rate at which the second mass oscillates with respect to the first and to maximize the oscillations of <span class="process-math">\(m_2\text{.}\)</span> If we choose <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> so that the second spring is in resonance with the first, the oscillations of the first mass force the second at its resonance frequency. Thus, we will have relatively large oscillations of the second mass and a large loss of energy.</p>
<p>Let us consider example.  Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(m_1 = 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(k_1 = 1\text{,}\)</span>   We will also choose <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> to be 0.05 and <span class="process-math">\(b = 0.1\text{.}\)</span>  If the initial conditions for our system are</p>

<p class="continuation">we will choose <span class="process-math">\(k_2\)</span> to tune our system. To do this we will plot the time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> that it takes for the amplitude of the oscillations of <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> to reach and stay below 2.5 for various values of <span class="process-math">\(k_2\text{.}\)</span>  If we choose <span class="process-math">\(k_2 \approx 0.05\text{,}\)</span> then we can  minimize the time to be <span class="process-math">\(t \approx 120\text{.}\)</span></p></article></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="nonlinear05.html#nonlinear05-project-tuned-mass-damper" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
