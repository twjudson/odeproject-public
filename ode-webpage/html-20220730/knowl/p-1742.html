<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/secondorder05-figure-gain.html" title="Figure 4.5.4">Figure 4.5.4</a> illustrates the power of differential equation modeling. For we can alter parameters in our equation and see the results in a physical (in this case electrical) system. Indeed, we see in this plot that for a capacitance of <span class="process-math">\(C = 0.0005\)</span> farads if we have an input voltage with a frequency around <span class="process-math">\(\omega = 45\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(44.7214\)</span> to be precise) then the gain is greatest. Optimization is a calculus problem and we merely have to take the derivative of gain with respect to <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> and find where it is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> All other frequencies give smaller gain for this particular capacitance. In fact, we can say that as we decrease our capacitance the optimal frequency; i.e., frequency which gives highest gain, decreases and we might want to look into this for a more exact relationship. We shall do that in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/secondorder05-task-tune-the-radio.html" title="Task 4.5.1.d: Tune the Radio">Task 4.5.1.d</a>.</p>
